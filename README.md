## *[In a few sentences, describe the main idea.]*
Prescription Adherence can be done (via email, call or sms) and remind patients when and how to take the drugs prescribed to them whether it’s after meals or before going to bed etc. Lifeline aims to be a product that allows users to access their medications/prescriptions, to manage their medication list, and to receive reminders for when and how to take their medications/prescriptions.

## *[Summarize the key features...]*
- The users are able to message each other provider, administrator, and patient through a chat medium within the app.
- The user on the administration side is able to upload documents, lab results, and other documents to the patient. The patient will be able to view the documents on their profile for easy access. The documents will be available for both users to view whenever (It’s not temporary).
- The user is able to access a personal account with their unique medical details.
- The user is able to create a profile and match with their provider using their healthcare providers’ name or with a unique code.
- The user is able to set up an appointment at a convenient time for them through a scheduling section of the application.
- The user on the administrative side will be able to make and log in to a personal profile as well as an office profile for where they work.
- The healthcare admin users will be able to display the dates and times that are available for their offices on their office profile. 
- The user is able to upload their health records in order for their provider to view.
- The user on the administrative side will be able to organize the appointments they have with their patients.
- Patient users are able to view upcoming appointments, new notifications and other pertinent items on a single home screen
